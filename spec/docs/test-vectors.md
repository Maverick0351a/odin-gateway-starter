# Test Vectors (Draft)

Will enumerate canonical payloads, CIDs, signatures, receipts, bundle roots. Linked to automated tests ensuring spec fidelity.

Planned sections:
1. Minimal envelope
2. Transform + policy allow
3. Chain of length 3
4. Export bundle + inclusion proof
5. Dual-sign (tenant) receipt sample
